From Rosen (6th ed.)

1.1: 33e) Construct a truth table for:

\[
(p \leftrightarrow q) \vee (\neg q \leftrightarrow r)
\]

1.2: 30) Show that the following is a tautology:

\[
(p \vee q) \wedge (\neg p \vee r) \rightarrow (q \vee r)
\]

1.4: 33) Rewrite each of these statements so that negations appear only within predicates:

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item $ \neg \forall x \forall y P(x,y) $
\item $ \neg \forall y \exists x P(x,y) $
\item $ \neg \forall y \forall x (P(x,y) \vee Q(x,y)) $
\item $ \neg ( \exists x \exists y \neg P(x,y) \wedge \forall x \forall y Q(x,y)) $
\item $ \neg \forall x ( \exists y \forall z P(x,y,z) \wedge \exists z \forall y P(x,y,z)) $
 \end{enumerate}

 1.6: 39) Prove that at least one of the real numbers $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ is greater than or equal to the average of these numbers.

 1.6: 40) Use Exercise 39 to show that if the first 10 positive integers are placed around a circle, in any order, there exist three integers in consecutive locations around the circle that have a sum greater than or equal to 17.

 1.7: 32) Prove that $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is irrational.

 2.1: 19c) Find the power set of $ \{ \emptyset , \{ \emptyset \} \} $

 2.4: 31) Determine whether each of these sets is countable or uncountable.  For those that are countable, exhibit a one-to-one correspondence between the set of natural numbers and that set.

 \begin{enumerate}[a)]
 \item the negative integers
 \item the even integers
 \item the real numbers between 0 and $1/2$
 \item integers that are multiples of 7
 \end{enumerate}
